# NY-Schools-and-Tax-Data
This project, a comprehensive data analysis of NYC public schools, leverages a relational database created in PostgreSQL and hosted on AWS RDS. The database was populated by integrating two distinct datasets: one containing NYC public school information and another with New York State taxpayer records, joined by ZIP code. Using Python, I conducted a location-based analysis to map over 1,000 schools across more than 150 ZIP codes to their respective boroughs and school districts. This enabled a granular spatial and socioeconomic analysis. By querying the database, I calculated key metrics such as average neighborhood income, schools per neighborhood, and regional tax patterns, ultimately identifying and visualizing significant disparities in educational access and income distribution throughout New York City.
