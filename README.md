# NY-Schools-and-Tax-Data
This project leverages a PostgreSQL relational database, integrating NYC public school and state taxpayer datasets. Using location-based analysis in Python, I mapped schools to their boroughs and districts. By querying the database, I calculated key metrics to identify disparities in educational access and income distribution across New York City.
