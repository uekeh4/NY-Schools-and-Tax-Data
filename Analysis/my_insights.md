Drawback from queries made on the relational database
### Query 3: Count schools per neighborhood with income data
Which neighborhoods have the highest concentration of schools. Can we see a pattern with this and average income?
- Lower-income areas (specifically the second-lowest income quartile, Q2) have the highest concentration of schools per 1,000 tax returns.
- Highest-income areas (Q4) have the lowest concentration of schools per capita. The lowest-income areas (Q1) and the middle-income areas (Q3) fall in between, suggesting a clear pattern of disparity in educational access when measured by school density.

### Query 4: Aggregate by neighborhood and school type
Compare highest income per return and school availability of a particular type within our neighborhoods
- `Kingsbridge Heights'` Department of Education schools has the highest average income per return of $840.14.
- `Queens Village's` Department of Education schools has a 2nd highest average income of $831.46.
- The majority of these neighborhoods with a top 10 average income per return have schools within the New York Department of Education

### Query 5: Compare income quartiles and school counts
Do high income areas have significantly more schools than lower income ones?

- The neighborhood with the most schools is `East Concourse-Concourse Village`, with 25 schools and an average income of $807.70 per return. 
- The  next-highest were `East New York`, `Brownsville`, `Chinatown`, and `Dumbo-Vinegar` with an average income of 776.97, 750.89, 772.97, and 785.59, respectively.
- With the results from each, we can determine the areas of high density of educational institutions and the incomes associated with each.
